Notes on debugging lab:

We are using gdb


If you want to debug things using core dumps, unlimit coredumpsize
first.  (Run "limit" to see your system limits.)


List of debugging commands:

    run                   starts program
    where                 shows runtime stack
    up                    goes up the runtime stack
    down                  goes down the runtime stack
    print VARIABLE        shows value of VARIABLE
    list                  shows code
    break [FILE:]LINE     set breakpoint in FILE at LINE
    watch VARIABLE        sets a watch on VARIABLE
    cont                  continues program
    

buggy.C:
	i++ on line 24 should be i--;

How we tested it:

	compiled with "-g": "g++ -g buggy.C -o buggy"
	ran "gdb buggy"
	gave the "run" command.

	dies with ( bus error | segmentation fault )

	"where" just says we're in main.

	"print i" says that it equals 588 (or some large number),
        which is probably wrong 

	"list" shows some code, and we see that there's an "i++" in
	the loop.  quit gdb and Change the line to "i--".

	recompile; run gdb again.
	now it works.


runoff.C:
	Line 29: "i <= ARRAY_SIZE" should be "<".

How we tested it:

	compiled with "-g": "g++ -g runoff.C -o runoff"
	ran "gdb runoff"
	gave "run" command

	variable "x" changes midstream
	"list" shows the code.
	we want to see more, so "list 20" lists the lines around line 20
	(to look farther down, we can do "list 25")

	Stop before the first time we print x by using a break.
	"break 22" sets a breakpoint at line 22.  (If we had multiple
	files, we could say "break runoff.C:22".)

	"run" has the program stop *before* it executes the line
	with the break.  "print x" shows us the value.

	Now we run "watch x", and then say "continue".

	We are told that x has been given a new value of 8, and
	that it happened at line 29.  Variable i is 3.

	Looking back over the code, we see that the first loop ends on
	"i <= ARRAY_SIZE", instead of "<".  Because of the way the compiler
	allocates space, "x" is at the end of the array.  So when we
	ran off the end of "a", we scribbled in "x".  At the time, the
	value of "i" was 3, so we stored things in a[5], which points at "x".



stack.C:
	Has one major bug.  This:
		  for (i = 0; i <= 5; i++)
		    cout << tester.pop() << " ";
	should be this:
		  for (i = 0; i < 5; i++)
		    cout << tester.pop() << " ";

How we tested it:

	
	compiled with "-g": "g++ -g stack.C -o stack"
	dies with segmentation fault

	ran "gdb stack core", so gdb got the source file and the core
    dump information

    The program died at line 42.  "print top" says that top is a
    pointer to a ListItem and has the hex value of "0".  (Ie, it is a
    null pointer.)  If "top" is null, then "top->data" can't be done:
    there isn't anything that "top" is pointing to.
		(Note: in some cases, gdb may say there isn't anything
		named "top".  If so, you can use "print this.top";
		giving the "this" specifically, so it knows which one
		you want.)

	"list 42" shows us the code, but it all looks okay.  The problem
	may be somewhere else.

	"where" tells us how we got here.

	Maybe the problem is in "main()", where we were called at line
	63.  We want to look at the data in there.

	"up" takes us to the function which called this function.
	(The stack as printed by "where" has main() *under* pop(),
	so you might think of that as going down, not up.  But if you
	look at the numbers, pop() is #0, and main() is #1, so we went
	up to the next higher number.)

	"list" shows us the code.  We're in a loop, so we look at the
	loop variable.

	"print i" says that it's equal to 5.

	looking at the loop, we see another "i <= 5", which should
	probably be "i < 5".

	We make the change and recompile.  Now it works.


NOTE: this last example has a more serious problem, in that it uses a
counter, indirectly keeping track of the size of the stack, instead of
a using a direct test on whether the stack has anything in it.  The
IntStack class which we are using has an "isEmpty()" function.  Before
we pop() anything off the stack, we should first check if it is empty.
That way, we'll never get a bogus pop.

Using this direct test in our loop, we can replace this:

	  for (i = 0; i < 5; i++)
	    cout << tester.pop() << " ";

with this:
	  while (! tester.isEmpty() ) {
	    cout << tester.pop() << " ";
	  }

The second one is more readable, for when this program needs to be
worked on later.  It's logical, in that we're looking over the whole
stack and we're stopping when the stack is empty.

This loop doesn't depend on any direct counter: if the stack has 30
things on it, none will be missed.  If the stack has 2 things on it (or
nothing at all), the while loop won't run off the end.



assertions:

If you "#include <assert.h>", then you can assert() any boolean at any
point in your program.  If it's false, the program stops with an error
message and dumps core.  (Probably not too useful to dig through the
core dump for most people.)


debug levels:

Just put "if (debuglevel > 1) " (or other such values as needed) into
your program.  Easiest to activate them with command-line switches.

You can do something like this:

/* global */
int DebugLevel = 0;

int main(int argc, char *argv[])

      while ... getopt .....

         case 'D': DebugLevel++; break;


Then, in the same file, you can do this:

    if (DebugLevel > 4) {
        printf("4: Closing file %s", inputfile);
    }

If you're debugging things in a different file than main(), you
have to say "extern int DebugLevel;", so the compiler knows to
look for the variable in a different file.

Then you can run it like:  foo -D  or  foo -DDDDD
