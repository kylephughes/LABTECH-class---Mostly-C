LED Dot Matrix Layout

The dot-matrix is 72 dots wide and 10 dots high.  It is stored as a set
of 90 bytes arranged in rows.

    Row 0   bytes  0- 8
    Row 1   bytes  9-17
    Row 2   bytes 18-26
    Row 3   bytes 27-35
     ...
    Row 9   bytes 81-89


The bytes are arranged with the MSB to the left, and going
left-to-right.  If bytes 0, 9, 18, 27, 36, 45, 54, 63, 72, and 81
were all set to 0x80, the result would be a solid bar on the left side
of the display.  To set a solid bar on the right side you would set
bytes 8, 17, 26, 35, 44, 53, 62, 71, and 89 to 0x01.

What you need to do is figure out which characters (up to 9) you want
to display, and put the bits from those characters in the right place
in the array.

Then you call the show() function, and it makes the screen match
what's stored in the array.
